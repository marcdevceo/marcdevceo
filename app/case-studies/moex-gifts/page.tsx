      <Subtitle>‚ù§Ô∏è The Backstory</Subtitle>
      <BodyText size="buttonText">
        MoEx Gifts started as more than just a dev project‚Äîit was born from a dream I had years ago.
        I once wanted to build an e-commerce business centered around meaningful gift giving.
        In a world overwhelmed with negativity, I wanted to create an outlet for people to express
        joy, love, and appreciation through intentional moments‚Äîmoments expressed.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText size="buttonText">
        This project gave that vision new life through code. And along the way, I leveled up in a
        big way as a developer.

      <BodyText size="buttonText">
        This wasn‚Äôt just another portfolio piece. MoEx Gifts was deeply personal.
        It reminded me of the power of combining purpose with creativity. It also
        showed me how far I‚Äôve come‚Äîfrom an idea on paper to a deployed, dynamic
        e-commerce app.

        For any developer, the turning point is when your code starts reflecting who you are.
        This app is that moment for me. And I'm proud of it.
